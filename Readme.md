# ASPxGridView - Export data to xml


<p>ASPxGridView actually does not provide this functionality, but it is possible to achieve this by getting data directly from a data source, which is bound to the ASPxGridView. In this sample ASPxGridView uses multi-row editing and is bound to the DataTable, generated dynamically.</p>
